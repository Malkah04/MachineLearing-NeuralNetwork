# 🧠 Machine Learning & Neural Network — Learning Journey (Python)

This repository contains my personal learning and practice in **Machine Learning** and **Neural Networks** using **Python**. The goal of this repo is to document my progress, experiment with different ideas, and build a strong foundation in ML concepts step-by-step.

---

## 📌 Contents
- Practice code
- Notes and experiments
- Neural network basics
- Machine learning concepts
- Python implementations for learning purposes

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- (Maybe later) TensorFlow, or PyTorch

---

## ✨ Goal
This repo is **not a big project**, but a space where I:
- Learn ML step by step
- Write and test code
- Understand how algorithms and neural networks really work

---

## ▶️ How to Use
Simply open any file, run it, and explore the code.  
This repo is mainly for studying, so expect many experiments and small scripts.

---

## 📌 Future Learning Topics
- Perceptron
- Gradient Descent
- Activation Functions
- Neural Network from scratch
- Machine learning algorithms
